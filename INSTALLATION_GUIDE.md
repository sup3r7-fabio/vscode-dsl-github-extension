# VSCode Extension Installation & Testing Guide

This guide explains how to install and test the GitHub Actions DSL VSCode extension.

## üì¶ Installation Methods

### Method 1: Install from VSIX Package (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Locate the VSIX file**:
   ```
   s:\development\github.com\golang-vibe-coding\vscode-extension\github-actions-dsl-1.0.0.vsix
   ```

2. **Install using VSCode UI**:
   - Open VSCode
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open command palette
   - Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
   - Select the command and choose the `.vsix` file
   - Restart VSCode when prompted

3. **Install using Command Line**:
   ```powershell
   cd "s:\development\github.com\golang-vibe-coding\vscode-extension"
   code --install-extension github-actions-dsl-1.0.0.vsix
   ```

### Method 2: Development Mode (For Development & Testing)

1. **Open Extension Development Host**:
   ```powershell
   cd "s:\development\github.com\golang-vibe-coding\vscode-extension"
   code .
   # Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
   ```

2. **Test in Development Host**:
   - A new VSCode window opens with the extension loaded
   - Open or create `.dsl` files to test functionality
   - Make changes to extension code and reload to test

## üß™ Testing the Extension

### Prerequisites
Ensure the DAP server is built before testing debugging features:
```powershell
cd "s:\development\github.com\golang-vibe-coding"
go build -o bin/dsl-dap ./cmd/dap
go build -o bin/golang-vibe-coding .
```

### Test 1: Syntax Highlighting
1. Open the example DSL file:
   ```
   s:\development\github.com\golang-vibe-coding\vscode-extension\example.dsl
   ```
2. Verify syntax highlighting is working:
   - Keywords like `name`, `on`, `jobs`, `steps` should be highlighted
   - Strings in quotes should be colored differently
   - Comments (lines starting with `#`) should be styled as comments
   - Expression interpolation (`${{ }}`) should be highlighted

### Test 2: Auto-completion
1. Create a new file with `.dsl` extension
2. Start typing workflow keywords:
   - Type `na` and press `Ctrl+Space` ‚Üí should suggest `name`
   - Type `o` and press `Ctrl+Space` ‚Üí should suggest `on`
   - Type `jo` and press `Ctrl+Space` ‚Üí should suggest `jobs`
3. Verify completion works in different contexts

### Test 3: Hover Information
1. Open a DSL file
2. Hover over keywords like:
   - `name` ‚Üí Should show "The name of the workflow"
   - `runs-on` ‚Üí Should show "The type of machine to run the job on"
   - `uses` ‚Üí Should show "Selects an action to run as part of a step"

### Test 4: Commands
Test extension commands via `Ctrl+Shift+P`:

1. **Start DAP Server**:
   - Command: "GitHub Actions DSL: Start DAP Server"
   - Should show success message and start server on port 4711

2. **Validate Syntax**:
   - Command: "GitHub Actions DSL: Validate DSL Syntax"
   - Open a DSL file first, then run command
   - Should show validation result

3. **Show AST Visualization**:
   - Command: "GitHub Actions DSL: Show AST Visualization" 
   - Should open a new panel with AST information

### Test 5: Debugging (Full DAP Integration)

#### Setup Debug Configuration
1. Create `.vscode/launch.json` in your workspace:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "type": "dsl",
         "request": "launch",
         "name": "Debug DSL File",
         "program": "${file}",
         "stopOnEntry": true,
         "autoStartDapServer": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

#### Test Debugging Flow
1. **Set Breakpoints**:
   - Open a DSL file (`example.dsl`)
   - Click in the gutter next to line numbers to set breakpoints
   - Breakpoints should appear as red dots

2. **Start Debug Session**:
   - Press `F5` or go to "Run > Start Debugging"
   - Select "Debug DSL File" configuration
   - Extension should automatically start DAP server
   - Debug session should begin

3. **Debug Controls**:
   - Test Continue (F5)
   - Test Step Over (F10)
   - Test Step Into (F11)
   - Test Step Out (Shift+F11)

4. **Variable Inspection**:
   - Check Variables panel for workflow context
   - Use Debug Console to evaluate expressions
   - Test hover evaluation over variables

### Test 6: Error Handling

1. **Invalid DSL Syntax**:
   - Create DSL file with syntax errors
   - Should see error highlighting
   - Validation command should report errors

2. **Missing DAP Server**:
   - Try debugging without DAP server built
   - Should prompt to build server first
   - Should handle connection failures gracefully

3. **Invalid Debug Configuration**:
   - Try debugging with malformed launch.json
   - Should show helpful error messages

## üìä Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Syntax highlighting works for all DSL constructs
- Auto-completion provides relevant suggestions
- Hover shows helpful documentation
- Commands execute without errors
- DAP server starts and accepts connections
- Breakpoints can be set and hit during debugging
- Variables and call stack are visible during debug sessions
- Debug controls (step, continue) work properly

### ‚ùå Common Issues and Solutions

#### Extension Not Loading
**Problem**: Extension doesn't appear to be active
**Solutions**:
- Check if `.dsl` files are present in workspace
- Reload window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"
- Check Output panel for errors: View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí "GitHub Actions DSL"

#### Syntax Highlighting Missing
**Problem**: DSL files show as plain text
**Solutions**:
- Ensure file has `.dsl` extension
- Set language manually: `Ctrl+K M` ‚Üí Select "GitHub Actions DSL"
- Verify extension is enabled: Extensions ‚Üí Search "GitHub Actions DSL"

#### DAP Server Won't Start
**Problem**: Debug server fails to start
**Solutions**:
```powershell
# Check if binary exists
ls bin/dsl-dap*

# Rebuild if missing
go build -o bin/dsl-dap ./cmd/dap

# Test manual start
.\bin\dsl-dap --dap-server --verbose

# Check port availability
netstat -an | findstr 4711
```

#### Debugging Not Working
**Problem**: Breakpoints not hit or debug session fails
**Solutions**:
- Ensure DAP server is running
- Check launch configuration is correct
- Verify file paths are accurate
- Enable verbose debug logging in settings
- Check Debug Console for error messages

#### Auto-completion Not Working
**Problem**: No suggestions appear
**Solutions**:
- Try triggering manually with `Ctrl+Space`
- Ensure cursor is in valid context
- Check that file is recognized as DSL language
- Restart VSCode if language features aren't loading

## üîß Development Testing

# Make changes to extension
# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Run tests (if available)
npm test

# Package for testing
npm run package

# Install and test
code --install-extension github-actions-dsl-1.0.0.vsix
